# Hey there, I’m Ashutosh! 👋

I’m a **DevOps Engineer** from Kathmandu, Nepal, who’s all about making systems smarter, faster, and just plain cooler. I love tinkering with Kubernetes, wrestling CI/CD pipelines into submission, and lately, poking around in blockchain stuff with Bittensor. If it involves automation or cloud magic, I’m probably obsessed with it.

## What I’m Up To These Days 🚀
- **Kubernetes Shenanigans**: I’m building custom operators with **KubeBuilder** and **Golang** to tame multi-user clusters—think of it like herding cats, but with code.  
- **Blockchain Adventures**: Playing with **Bittensor** and Python to figure out how decentralized tech can shake up infrastructure. It’s tough.
- **Cloud Life**: I’m always deploying something with **Docker**, **Helm**, and **Terraform**, usually powered by **GitHub Actions** or **Jenkins**. Keeps me on my toes!

## My Toolbox 🛠️
- **Coding**: Python (my go-to), Golang (for the fancy stuff), Node.js, Bash  
- **Cloud**: AWS (EC2, ECS, Lambda, Cloudwatch), Azure  
- **Container orchestration**: Kubernetes, Docker, Helm, KubeBuilder  
- **IaC**: Terraform, CloudFormation  
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Bitbucket CI  
- **Monitoring**: Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack, Zabbix  
- **Security**: Snyk (SAST), ZAP (DAST) ~ somewhat
- **Extras**: Git, Linux, GitOps, Bittensor

## School & Badges 🎓
- **B.E. in Electronics and Communication** – Kathmandu Engineering College (2017–2022)  
  Where I first got hooked on tech.  
- **Certifications**: AWS Essential Workshop (2021), Linux Essentials (Cisco, 2022), Python Intermediate (Cisco, 2023)
